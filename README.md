# FeeInvoice

University fee invoice generator that takes user input, and outputs information to the screen 

I could only use one class and no loops (If I had more freedom, I would create an object for each student, comprising their name, ID, course number, and credit hours. 
I would then use this object for printing, and I would also enhance its appearance using a GUI.)
